# trainging XML
This folder contains real BigFix API XML from various transactions
in my BigFix lab.

All of this is obtained using curl.

Basically, this will start with the "plurals" and then one to many 
of the singulars. We want to create go struct/types that can marshal
and unmarshal to and from both XML and JSON.

The purpose of this application is to make browsing one to many BigFix
servers with a single mobile app feasible.
